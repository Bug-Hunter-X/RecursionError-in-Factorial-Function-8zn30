This repository contains a Python code example demonstrating a common error: RecursionError in recursive functions. The `bug.py` file shows the buggy code, while `bugSolution.py` provides a corrected version. The bug arises from the lack of input validation in the recursive factorial function. The solution adds a check for negative input, preventing the infinite recursion.
